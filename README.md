# Website of James Dean
A website for my own personal use.  It is presently hosted [here, on Github Pages](https://jamesdean.me/).

This site is based on the [Dimension site template](https://github.com/codebushi/nextjs-starter-dimension), designed by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/dimension). Check out https://codebushi.com/nextjs-website-starters/ for more Next.js starters and templates.

## Licensing
The template has since been heavily modified, but most of these modifications are available for your own use.

Just be wary: **not everything in this repo falls under the MIT license** that is described in the `LICENSE` file.

Any content and code that is unique to the website's personalization are restricted from open-source use; these portions are meant to describe me and my work and **not intended for use by someone else**.

Some of the content stored in this repo is also licensed to me, James Dean, exclusively for use by or distribution with **this personalized website only**.

As a general rule, the following fall under the included open-source license:
* All configuration files in the root of the repo.
* The `components` folder.
* The `lib` folder.
