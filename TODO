* Fix IE support; scroll-to-top was broken at some point.
* Add more accessible `alt` descriptions for images.
* Provide our own `_error` page; create a route to it for `404.html` and
  specially handle the 404 status code.  `getInitialProps` should expect
  a special query from the route to know its a `404.html` hit, specifically.
  (Much of this is now complete, but I still want to run through it.)
* Related: check out React error-boundaries.
* Go through and refactor types in documentation.
  Make sure they follow these guidelines: http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html
* Try and kill off prop-types.
  It seems some `node_modules` are still requiring it.
