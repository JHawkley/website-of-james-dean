* Go through and refactor types in documentation.
  Make sure they follow these guidelines: http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html
* Try and kill off prop-types.
  It seems some `node_modules` are still requiring it.
* There are still some Babel helpers that are inlined in the code
  of a few node_modules.  These could possibly be transformed into
  imports.
