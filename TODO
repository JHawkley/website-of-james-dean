* Add more accessible `alt` descriptions for images.
* Redesign `Preloader` and classes that extend it to use composition
  instead of inheritance.
* Provide our own `_error` page; create a route to it for `404.html` and
  specially handle the 404 status code.  `getInitialProps` should expect
  a special query from the route to know its a `404.html` hit, specifically.
* Related: check out React error-boundaries.
* Go through and refactor types in documentation.
  Make sure they follow these guidelines: http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html
